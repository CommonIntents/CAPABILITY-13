# CAPABILITY-13 — Consensus Authentication Protocol [![Org](https://img.shields.io/badge/Org-CommonIntents-144-darkgray.svg)](https://github.com/CommonIntents)

**What you see is what you sign.** CAPABILITY-13 provides a verifiable confirmation mechanism based on Cellrix's deterministic visual rendering.

CAPABILITY-13 defines the structure of user confirmation events — carrying the visual content hash of the Cellrix interface that the user actually saw and agreed to. This bridges the semantic gap between AI intent and human authorization.

## What CAPABILITY-13 Defines
- **Confirmation Event** — structured event carrying Cellrix view hash + user action
- **Decision Queue** — asynchronous HITL (human-in-the-loop) state machine
- **Consensus Anchor** — the Cellrix-rendered interface is the ground truth for both human and AI

## Core Philosophy
> *Not declared, means it does not exist.*
> *Extensions not activated mean zero overhead.*
